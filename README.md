# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my private github profile. Much of day-to-day professional development work will not show up here and many of my private hobby work is not public. Not at the moment at least. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own web publishing platform. It's my version of TODO-apps.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go, Zig, Neovim and everything related to them.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some cool Neovim plugin or perhaps some helpful cli tool.
